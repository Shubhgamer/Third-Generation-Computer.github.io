<font size="4"> The third generation computer used intehrated circuits (ICs) in which the small transistors were placed on silicon chips; called semiconductorss. IBM 360; ICL 1900 and VAX-750 are example of third generation computer. </font> <br> <p align="center"> <img src="![Integrated circuit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73688063/98220382-39b89e80-1f74-11eb-86cc-8f72b2c6af6e.jpg)"> </p>
<font size="6"> <font color="orange"> Advantages </font>
<hr style="border-width: 5px; margin-right: 1300px; border-color: orange">
<font size="4"> These computers were smaller in size than the computers of earlier generations. <br>
Thier speed and accuracy were better than the first and second generation computers. <br>
They generated lesser amount of heat and were less expensive than the computers of earlier generations. <br>
They were based on high-level language which was easier to understand and machine-independent. </font> <br>
<font size="6">	<font color="orange"> Disadvantages </font>
<hr style="border-width: 5px; margin-right: 1200px; border-color: orange">
<font size="4"> They required air conditioning. <br>
	            Highly sophisticated technology was required for the manufacturing of IC chips.
